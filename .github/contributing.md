Please refer to the [documentation](https://typehaus.org/documentation) before proceeding with a PR.

### Submitting a Pull Request

I will only review PRs that are small and isolated and can be easily described and understood within the context of the PR rather than even needing to open it.

When saving the file for your PR close all other open tabs and leave one remaining with the added/modified glyphs visible. This makes it much easier to review PRs.

Please **do**:

- Run the autospacing on your modified/created glyph before submitting as a PR
- Add relevant bubble kern to any modified/created glyph and set up as drescribed above
- Apply to all weights and both normal/italic where appropriate

Please **do not**:

- Modify any autospacing settings
- Modify any other kern bubbles
- Set manual kerns (or indeed run the kerning tool at all)
- Modify any glyphs not related to your changes

As a general rule, a small isolated commit should equal a small isolated PR.
